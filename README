This is a little C library I wrote that implements some very basic machine learning. The library depends on the GSL scientific library,
so make sure to have that installed.

Please note that the MNIST library in .csv format is required to run the provided examples. This can be downloaded from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/oddrationale/mnist-in-csv/.

Important to note is that when running the main example "example.out" the configuration
is determined by tconfig.yml. There are currently these options:

-f filename    --Loads in a pre-trained network setting file.
-s filename    --Enables 'one-shot' mode, where only one image is loaded in and tested. Training and svaing disabled.
-p             --Print mode. Makes the network occasionally print out what one of its input files looks like
				 alongside the network's categorization.
