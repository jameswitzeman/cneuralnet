This is a little C library I wrote that implements some very basic machine learning.

Important to note is that when running the main example "example.out" the configuration
is determined by tconfig.yml. There are currently these options:

-f filename    --Loads in a pre-trained network setting file.
-s filename    --Enables 'one-shot' mode, where only one image is loaded in and tested. Training and svaing disabled.
-p             --Print mode. Makes the network occasionally print out what one of its input files looks like
				 alongside the network's categorization.
