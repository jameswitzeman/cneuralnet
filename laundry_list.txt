Laundry list of stuff to add/fix with code:

-Make train() & test() more usable as standalone functions
	-Allow user to pass info to train() in such a way that train()
	 can use several different cost functions, activation functions,
	 etc
-Generalize functionality for more implementations (not just image recognition)
-Support for convolutional networks
